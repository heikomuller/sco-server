# Standard Cortical Observer - Data Store Web API

Web API to access resources (e.g. images, subject anatomies) managed by the
Standard Cortical Observer Data Store.

The API is intended to provide access to resources that are input to run a
predictive model (i.e., subject, images, experiments, and functional data) as
well as outputs from model runs (i.e., predictions).

Use the init_model_repository module to load initial model definitions into the model repository.
