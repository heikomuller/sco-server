# Standard Cortical Observer - Web API

Web API to access different resources managed by the Standard Cortical Observer.
At this stage the API primarily gives access to resources that are needed to
run predictions (i.e., subject, images, experiments, and functional data). The
functionality needed to run a model will either be added or be part of a
separate API that exposes access to a simple workflow engine.
