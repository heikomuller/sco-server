<p class="info">The broad goal of the <b>Standard Cortical Observer Project</b>
is to develop software and computational methods to predict fMRI responses across
visual cortex to arbitrary images. Toward this end, we plan to implement and
organize existing core knowledge about functional imaging of human visual
cortex, and build on the existing knowledge where applicable.</p>
<p class="info">The project combines two types of models: a voxel-wise population
receptive field (pRF) model that predicts BOLD responses given an image, and a
cortical template that assigns retinotopic coordinates to positions on the
cortex based on anatomy. Currently, we are using an updated version of
<a class="text-link" href="https://cfn.upenn.edu/aguirre/wiki/public:retinotopy_template">
Noah Benson's V1-V3 anatomical template (Benson et al, 2014)</a>, and
<a class="text-link" href="http://kendrickkay.net/socmodel/">Kendrick Kay's
two-stage cascade pRF model (Kay et al, 2013, PLoS CB)</a>. For the project, we
added a mapping between visual field coordinates derived from the template and
the voxel-wise pRF parameters. Going forward, we will extend the voxel-wise
model to be multi-scale rather than limited to a single spatial frequency band,
and we will develop software infrastructure to facilitate model development and
model comparison, and to house a database of stimuli, fMRI responses, and
anatomical MRI.</p>

<p class="repo-info">Data store API for primary data objects (i.e. experiments, functional
data, predictions, images, and subject anatomies) that are managed and manipulated by
the Standard Cortical Observer. The API is a standalone library that is used by the
SCO Web API but can also be used in an offline setting to manipulate SCO resources.</p>
