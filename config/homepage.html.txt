<p class="info">The broad goal of the <b>Standard Cortical Observer Project</b>
is to develop software and computational methods to predict fMRI responses across
visual cortex to arbitrary images. Toward this end, we plan to implement and
organize existing core knowledge about functional imaging of human visual
cortex, and build on the existing knowledge where applicable.</p>
<p class="info">The project combines two types of models: a voxel-wise population
receptive field (pRF) model that predicts BOLD responses given an image, and a
cortical template that assigns retinotopic coordinates to positions on the
cortex based on anatomy. Currently, we are using an updated version of
<a class="text-link" href="https://cfn.upenn.edu/aguirre/wiki/public:retinotopy_template">
Noah Benson's V1-V3 anatomical template (Benson et al, 2014)</a>, and
<a class="text-link" href="http://kendrickkay.net/socmodel/">Kendrick Kay's
two-stage cascade pRF model (Kay et al, 2013, PLoS CB)</a>. For the project, we
added a mapping between visual field coordinates derived from the template and
the voxel-wise pRF parameters. Going forward, we will extend the voxel-wise
model to be multi-scale rather than limited to a single spatial frequency band,
and we will develop software infrastructure to facilitate model development and
model comparison, and to house a database of stimuli, fMRI responses, and
anatomical MRI.</p>

<h3 class="doc-headline">Project Sources</h3>

<p class="info">The source code for this project is distributed across several repositories.
Here is a high-level overview of the overall system architecture and the individual repositories.</p>

    <a class="repo-link" href="https://github.com/WinawerLab/sco">SCO</a>
</p>

<p class="repo-info">The Standard Cortical Observer (SCO) library is intended as
both a model and a modeling framework for predicting cortical responses to visual
stimuli. The library can be run directly or called from Python code, and it is
designed such that model comparison and modification are easy.</p>

    <a class="repo-link" href="https://github.com/heikomuller/sco-datastore">Data Store</a>
</p>

<p class="repo-info">Data store API for primary data objects (i.e. experiments, functional
data, predictions, images, and subject anatomies) that are managed and manipulated by
the Standard Cortical Observer. The API is a standalone library that is used by the
SCO Web API but can also be used in an offline setting to manipulate objects.</p>

    <a class="repo-link" href="https://github.com/heikomuller/sco-engine">Engine</a>
</p>

<p class="repo-info">The workflow engine maintains a registry of predictive models
and co-ordinates model execution. The actual workflow is executed by workers that
are defined in the <a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/heikomuller/sco-worker">
SCO Worker module</a>. The intention behind a separate engine module is to
decouple the web service from the predictive model code.</p>

    <a class="repo-link" href="https://github.com/heikomuller/sco-server">Web Service</a>
</p>

<p class="repo-info">Web API to access and manipulate resources that are managed
by the <a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/heikomuller/sco-datastore">Data Store</a>.
A documentation of the Web API can be found <a class="text-link" href="http://cds-jaw.cims.nyu.edu/sco-server/api/v1/doc/">here</a>.</p>

    <a class="repo-link" href="https://github.com/heikomuller/sco-worker">Worker</a>
</p>

<p class="repo-info">Workers are used to execute predictive model run requests.
These workers may run locally on the same machine as the data store or on a
remote machine (using the client to communicate with the data store via the Web
Service).</p>

    <a class="repo-link" href="https://github.com/heikomuller/sco-client">Client</a>
</p>

<p class="repo-info">Python library to interact with Standard Cortical Observer
Web API's (SCO-API). The client provides methods to access resources managed by
an SCO-API running on a remote machine. Using the client library one can develop
code (e.g. predictive models) that run on a local machine but access resources
from a SCO Web Service.</p>
